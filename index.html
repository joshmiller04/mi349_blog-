        <h2>Tigers Are Hot!</h2>

            As a lifelong Detroit Tigers fan, I can't tell you how exciting it is to see our team on such an impressive winning streak. 
            It feels like just yesterday we were talking about rebuilding and finding our footing. 
            One of the standout moments for me was that recent game where we came from behind in the late innings. 
            The intensity was palpable! Watching the team rally together, scoring runs, and ultimately clinching the win was a true testament to their grit and determination. It reminded me why I fell in love with this team in the first place. Not only are we winning, but we are also seeing some young talent emerge. It is refreshing to watch our rookies step up and make significant contributions. It gives me hope for the future of the franchise. I can not wait to see how these players develop and help carry the team forward. There is nothing quite like sharing these moments with fellow fans, high-fiving strangers after a big home run, or collectively holding our breath during a tense moment in the game. It is a reminder that baseball is more than just a sport. As we continue this hot streak, I am feeling more hopeful than ever. Whether you are a die-hard fan or someone just getting into baseball, I encourage you to catch a game if you can. There is something special about being in the stands, cheering on the Tigers as they chase victory.</p>

            <h4>Publish date: Oct 9, 2024</h4>
            <p>I have been hearing a lot about Hurricane Milton. To be honest, I don't know much about hurricanes, but I do know that they have the potential to be quite strong and destructive. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone impacted by the storm, since the reports I've read are really alarming. I can only imagine the anxiety and the unknown at this moment. The toll that disasters like this can take on individuals, families, and communities is difficult to imagine. I want to take a minute to wish safety and good health to everyone who is experiencing Hurricane Milton. Please take care of yourself and your loved ones if you are in an affected region. Don't take any chances, follow the authorities in your area, and evacuate if required. It's vital to be aware and organized since it's simple to misjudge a hurricane's power. We appreciate all of the volunteers, emergency services, and everyone else offering assistance. Your bravery and commitment in these difficult situations is truly appreciated. I will be keeping everyone in my thoughts as Hurricane Milton makes its way through. Let us all hope for the best and look out for each other in whatever way we can. Stay safe, and take care! Sending positive vibes your way.</p>
